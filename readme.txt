learning is something that I always look for and with Hackathon like these I definitely believe that there is a lot to learn. I came into this Hackathon to check out the coolest hardware available, and Leap motion attracted me the most. Getting to know about it and working with it was super exciting. 

I initially tried to write a Java program that would detect my hand gestures, fingers, palm. After successfully understanding the motion frames and interacting with leap motion I tried to integrate voice recognition along with motion sensors. Overall it was a great experience participating in my first ever Hackathon. Thanks HackUTD, ACM, MLH.
